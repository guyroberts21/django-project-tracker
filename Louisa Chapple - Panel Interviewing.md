## My Introduction (by Anjali)
**Guy:** Guy has recently rolled off the Developer Grad Scheme in GTIS. He currently works as an engineer in BCP (Barclays Container Platform). In addition to his BAU work, he works as a GAIN Ambassador, supports a Radbroke Speaking group, and is currently working with a team to launch the first GTIS/CTO early careers town hall. 
*(optional fun fact - hopefully it's not just a weird fact..!)*
Guy eats 4 different types of oats every day. Yes, 4 types. That is porridge oats, oat milk, oat biscuits, and granola.
## My questions to Louisa (reflections and advice)

**Top Tip:**
- *Avoid cold questions - reflect and repeat back what you heard (deeply listen) before asking the next question.* 

It's great to hear about how you've approached learning, development, and also how you tackled any challenges along the way, and now looking at mentorship, 

1. Can you share any moments where someone's mentorship or support made a big difference to you? 
2. What's a question you wish more early careers colleagues would ask senior leaders? 
3. How do you think early career colleagues can build more visibility and influence within a large organisation? 
## Audience Q&A

**Saransh:** What role does job architecture and colleague experience play in your vision for HR at Barclays?

**Priyanshi:** How do you maintain work-life balance while still progressing your career?

**Alina:** What's one skill you think everyone should develop regardless of their role? 

*Spare: What skills or mindsets helped you stand out early on?*
## Final Question
> Take short notepad and write these down during the sessions! Then use it as a recap here before the last question.

*Notes:*
- 

Q: If you could go back and give your graduate self one piece of advice, what would it be?

## Thank you to Louisa

Great finish to the session! And we've just finished on time. 

Louisa, thank you so much for your time, and for sharing so many useful insights here. 

I know that I'm gunna be rewatching this recording again, to take a whole lot of notes, so thank you very much. 

To everyone else, if there are any questions that we've not answered, we'll get to these offline. 

And we will post the recording after the session ends shortly, and hope you all have a lovely rest of your day. 

Thank you.
