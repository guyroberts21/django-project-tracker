## My Introduction 

Hi, I'm Guy, I recently rolled off the grad scheme in GTIS, where I work in BCP (Barclays Container Platform). And it's a privilege to be speaking with Louisa Chapple today! 
- (optional) - I was recently asked for a fun fact about myself, and I got teased for it. My fact is that I eat 4 different types of oats every day. Yes, 4 types. That is porridge oats, oat milk, oat biscuits, and granola.

**Questions:**
1. Will I need an introduction for this panel session? 
2. Outro section? Who will be taking this part? 
3. What is the highlighted question? 
## My questions to Louisa

1. Can you share any moments where someone's mentorship or support made a big difference to you? 
2. What's a question you wish more early careers colleagues would ask senior leaders? 
3. How do you think early career colleagues can build more visibility and influence within a large organisation? 
4. If you could go back and give your graduate self one piece of advice, what would it be? 

### Thank you to Louisa

Thank you so much Louisa for your time, and for sharing so many useful insights here. I know that I'm gunna be watching this recording again, to take a whole lot of notes, so thank you.
