`1 - THE FUNDAMENTAL WHY`

I have been contributing as an Ambassador in GAIN since November 2023. I have thoroughly appreciated being part of the community as it has had a profound impact on both my professional and personal life. Before coming to Barclays, I would frequently shy away from opportunities, usually from a lack of self-confidence. It was only through meeting other early-careers, via events and networking opportunities (often provided by GAIN) that I gained the courage to start exploring opportunities. I am therefore incredibly passionate about supporting early-careers because I know how important it is to have such a strong support network. I joined as a Graduate at Barclays in 2023, and it has been a constant learning process, with a steep curve! GAIN provides this network immediately to new joiners, and I think it is greatly appreciated by all early-careers. The huge number of events organised by GAIN ambassadors is impressive, and I hope to continue supporting and highlighting the successes of all ambassadors who contribute.

The reason I am interested in the GAIN Co-Chair position is because I believe it would challenge me to explore, strategise, and collaborate with others on ways to further improve the early-career experience as a whole. I also believe that I have the necessary skills and qualities to successfully help lead the organisation.

`2 - GAIN LEADERSHIP EVOLUTION`

I have always thought that GAIN has been led exceptionally well, and it has taught me so much about what makes an effective leader. Ellie, Tom - without regard to the application, I really think you've been outstanding in enhancing this community outside of your regular role. I think you have empowered so many Ambassadors to learn skills beyond their usual roles, and encouraged them to take accountability for the direction of their careers.

Since I joined GAIN, there has been a huge amount of growth in the community; growing from around 50 Ambassadors to now having upwards of 150. As an Ambassador in GAIN, I have always felt supported to make useful contributions and that I could explore ideas or potential initiatives within my team. I would love for all GAIN Ambassadors and members to feel this way, and I feel inspired to make this a reality.

---
`3 - EXPERIENCE IN GAIN`

I joined the Comms & Governance Workstream and have remained there since becoming an Ambassador. I initially started working alongside Ellie and James (who has now stepped away from GAIN) where I gained a deep understanding of the processes and operations in GAIN. I saw how the whole community "worked" from behind the scenes. From onboarding new Ambassadors, to developing monthly Ambassador newsletters, to evaluating and analysing the engagement and feedback from Ambassadors, I have a strong feel for how GAIN functions, and how we could continue its growth.

---
`4 - TIMING AND PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT`

Having recently landed in my final rotation on the Graduate Scheme where I will be staying indefinitely, I now feel that I have the capacity to provide more to the GAIN community. I am someone who always seeks further development and opportunities to enhance my soft skills, particularly since my BAU role is highly technical. In terms of my personal development, I have a strong interest in learning more about how to lead an organisation, developing my communication skills, and in working with some inspirational people to build something extraordinary!

## How will you approach and fulfil the duties described by the role?

**Structure of answer:**
1. What effective leadership means to me
2. How I would effectively engage with GAIN's key stakeholders
3. How I would demonstrate good people-leading skills
4. How I would support ambassadors and maintain their engagement
5. How I would manage risk and controls with due care
6. How I would approach the GAIN budget
7. How I would continuously improve GAIN
8. How I would drive GAIN's strategy and purpose

---
`1 - WHAT IS EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP`

As a leader, I believe that being effective involves having a clear vision that all team members are aligned to. The vision serves as the foundation, upon which trust, accountability, and psychological safety are built. I always strive to be adaptable, listen actively, and align all decisions to the our core mission and values.

---
`2 - ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS`

Open and clear communication with stakeholders is critical for GAIN's success. I'm aware that Co-Chairs already meet regularly with HR and organisational leaders, and I would focus these discussions GAIN's strategy, risk mitigation, and ambassador/member engagement. To maximise productivity, I would prepare concise agendas and actionable items to ensure that the meetings were outcome-focused and aligned with GAIN's goals.

---
`3 - BEING A PEOPLE-LEADER`

Beyond frequent 121s with GAIN leads, I would work closely with all ambassadors where possible to enhance team collaboration, and reduce any sense of hierarchical boundaries. Delegating responsibilities - such as forming a dedicated Treasury Team - would empower ambassadors to take ownership, and avoid micro-management. With inspiration from Jason (co-lead for Comms & Governance), I would also seek development opportunities for all ambassadors to align with their career aspirations.

---
`4 - IMPROVING ENGAGEMENT AND SUPPORTING AMBASSADORS`

The Ambassador Feedback Survey provided valuable insights, so I would implement this quarterly to refine our engagement strategy. I would also ensure the continued success of the monthly Ambassador Newsletters to recognise the efforts of ambassadors and share updates.

I would additionally introduce a GAIN Roadmap to outline strategic deliverables and key Barclays events (eg. interns/new-joiners, cultural celebrations). Having a visual tool available to all ambassadors would help them to align their work with priorities and prepare for any major events.

---
`5 - MAINTAINING RISK AND CONTROLS`

Given that GAIN is a HR-owned product, all decisions and risks would be escalated upwards for HR to review. My first step as Co-Chair would be to work with Ellie to formalise GAIN policies into a central resource and familiarise myself with them. Then before making any decision, I would always ask: does this decision align with our standards, risks and controls? I believe it would be necessary to have a system like this to maintain consistency and guarantee the safety of all ambassadors.

---
`6 - MANAGING THE GAIN BUDGET`

Budgeting would reflect the roadmap's priorities, allocating funds to projects like cultural events or the arrival of new-joiners, with allowance for unforeseen expenses too. Having transparent updates to stakeholders would ensure that they are aligned and informed about GAIN's plans and activity.

---
`7 - CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND CONSISTENTLY EXCELLENT`

I would implement a weekly review process, asking: What went well? What didn't go so well? What did we learn? I would also seek feedback from leads on GAIN's processes and leadership to identify opportunities for growth/development.

---
`8 - STRATEGY AND PURPOSE`

As co-chair I would collaborate with Ellie to draft a purpose-driven strategy, which could then be refined with input from GAIN leads, before presenting to HR. To improve our decision-making and ensure alignment, we could regularly ask, "How does this decision benefit our strategy and values in GAIN?" (eg. in a weekly co-chair review meeting).

## What action to develop the GAIN strategy and propel the network forward?

**Structure of answer:**
1. Enriching and useful events for early-careers
2. Improving the experience of all members and ambassadors
3. Highlighting GAIN's presence and position at Barclays
4. Simplifying GAIN's processes and improving efficiency
5. Developing the strategy beyond 2024-25

`0 - INTRODUCTION`

The GAIN 2024-25 Strategy involves four key components: purposeful output, people, brand/engagement, and simple/straightforward.

---
`1 - ENRICHING AND USEFUL EVENTS`
> Example Q: What kind of events and content would early-careers find enriching and useful?

To deliver purposeful output, events that bring people together to share insights, ask questions, and connect with one another are particularly impactful for early-careers. While GAIN already offers practical and tailored events/content, regular and periodic networking sessions per location would strengthen connections and create more opportunities for knowledge-sharing.

To highlight GAIN's focus on career development, we could leverage the Viva Engage platform and our quarterly member newsletters to share insights from ambassadors, among other communications. This could include topics such as leadership, balancing technical/soft skills, or certifications that would highlight ambassadors' benefit from the role, and add value for members.

---
`2 - IMPROVING THE EXPERIENCE OF ALL MEMBERS/AMBASSADORS`
> Example Q: How can we improve the experience of all members and ambassadors?

For our people-focused strategy, I would introduce a mentorship programme to pair alumni (those who have rolled-off the programme) and current graduates/apprentices to further support GAIN members. This would act as a GAIN product with a structured sign-up process, where we would actively recruit alumni mentors.

For ambassadors, a sense of community is essential. Creating a social committee to organise both in-person and virtual networking/socials for ambassadors would encourage collaboration. As the number of ambassadors continues to grow, engagement and retention are priorities.

---
`3 - HIGHLIGHTING PRESENCE AND POSITION/BRANDING`
> Example Q: How will we improve GAIN's overall presence and position at Barclays?

Later this year, we will fully integrate the new branding into all communications, early-careers monthly calls, and ambassador resources. Viva Engage can provide weekly or monthly updates, rather than relying solely on quarterly newsletters, to ensure that we can provide engaging content to members consistently. We will also host networking and GAIN awareness events at sites with the newly appointed site-representatives to build more engagement in these under-represented areas.

---
`4 - SIMPLIFYING PROCESSES AND WAYS OF WORKING`
> Example Q: How can we simplify GAIN's processes and improve our efficiency and ways of working?

For our simple and straightforward strategy, we would streamline GAIN's operations by creating specialised ambassador teams. A dedicated treasury team would reduce the number of approvals for events, and a social committee could maintain regular internal networking. The social committee may also serve as a place for leads or ambassadors to transition into when they're to step down from their role.

To improve internal collaboration, we can encourage more knowledge-sharing via the MS Teams Channel which is used sparingly right now. New-joiners especially should feel free to ask questions whenever they are stuck.

---
`5 - DEVELOPING THE STRATEGY BEYOND 2024-25`
> Example Q: What actions can we take beyond the 2024-25 strategy and how might this evolve?

Beyond this year's purpose-driven strategy, scalable systems are required for long-term growth. Having dedicated internal teams would in turn allow us to provide more tailored development opportunities for ambassadors that align with their career goals via our onboarding process. Collaborating further with other ERGs, senior stakeholders, and business areas would align GAIN with Barclays' functions. We can adopt the proven frameworks and strategies already embedded in the bank - such as organisational structures or engagement tactics - to ensure scalability and operational efficiency of the GAIN ecosystem.
