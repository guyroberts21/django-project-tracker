## Why do you want to be Comms & Governance Co-Lead?

As a GAIN Ambassador since 2023, I've seen first hand how the network empowers early-careers. Under your and Katelyn's leadership, I have always felt supported to make useful contributions, and I am inspired to help all ambassadors within comms feel this way. From onboarding new Ambassadors, to developing monthly Ambassador newsletters, to evaluating and analysing the engagement and feedback from Ambassadors, I understand how GAIN functions, and how to develop it from a Comms perspective. In terms of my personal development, I'm passionate leading organisations, enhancing communication, and collaborating with inspirational people to build something extraordinary. 

## What is one initiative you would like to champion as Comms & Governance Co-Lead?

I would take ownership of GAIN's global awareness and engagement strategy. To highlight GAIN's focus on career development, we could leverage the Viva Engage platform and our quarterly member newsletters to share insights from ambassadors, among other communications. This could include topics such as leadership, balancing technical/soft skills, or certifications that would highlight ambassadors' benefit from the role, and add value for members. Viva Engage can provide weekly or monthly updates, rather than relying solely on quarterly newsletters, to ensure that we can provide engaging content to members consistently. I would also facilitate networking and GAIN awareness events at sites with the newly appointed site-representatives to build more engagement in these under-represented areas.
I'm currently pursuing a Marketing CIM L4 Qualification, which is allowing me to think more strategically about developing strategy in an organisation. 

## What unique skills/experience will you bring to the Comms & Governance Co-Lead role? 

As a leader, I believe that being effective involves having a clear vision that all team members are aligned to. The vision serves as the foundation, upon which trust, accountability, and psychological safety are built. I always strive to be adaptable, listen actively, and align all decisions to the our core mission and values. 

From my BAU role, I have learnt about how we might introduce a GAIN Roadmap to outline strategic deliverables and key Barclays events (eg. interns/new-joiners, cultural celebrations). I would also ensure the continued success of the monthly Ambassador Newsletters to recognise the efforts of ambassadors and share updates.

I would also implement a weekly review process, asking: What went well? What didn't go so well? What did we learn? I would also connect with other GAIN leads to learn about how they are managing their teams to identify opportunities for growth/development within C&G.
