Alright — I’ll give you two things here:

1. **A minimal OpenShift YAML** that creates a webhook listener pod, service, and route.
2. **An Ansible Controller notification example** that points to it.

I’ll also note the **experience required** so you know what’s involved in setup and testing.

---

## **1️⃣ Minimal OpenShift Webhook Listener**

We’ll use a lightweight HTTP echo container that will just respond with whatever request it receives — perfect for testing webhook payloads.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: webhook-listener
  labels:
    app: webhook-listener
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: webhook-listener
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: webhook-listener
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: webhook-listener
          image: hashicorp/http-echo:0.2.3
          args:
            - "-text=Webhook received!"
            - "-listen=:8080"
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: webhook-listener
spec:
  selector:
    app: webhook-listener
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
---
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: webhook-listener
spec:
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: webhook-listener
  port:
    targetPort: 80
  tls:
    termination: edge
```

**How this works:**

* **Deployment** runs `hashicorp/http-echo` — responds with `"Webhook received!"` to any HTTP request.
* **Service** exposes the pod internally at port 80.
* **Route** makes it accessible externally via HTTPS (edge-terminated).

After applying:

```bash
oc apply -f webhook-listener.yaml
```

You’ll get a public route URL:

```bash
oc get route webhook-listener -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'
```

Example:

```
webhook-listener-test.apps.cluster-1234.example.com
```

Your webhook endpoint will then be:

```
https://webhook-listener-test.apps.cluster-1234.example.com/
```

---

## **2️⃣ Ansible Controller Webhook Notification Example**

In Ansible Controller, create a **Notification Template** of type **Webhook**:

| Field                 | Value                                                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**              | Test OpenShift Webhook                                         |
| **Description**       | Sends notification to OpenShift webhook listener               |
| **Organization**      | `<Your Org>`                                                   |
| **Notification Type** | Webhook                                                        |
| **Target URL**        | `https://webhook-listener-test.apps.cluster-1234.example.com/` |
| **Username**          | `testuser` *(optional)*                                        |
| **Password / Token**  | `supersecret` *(optional)*                                     |
| **HTTP Headers**      | `{"Content-Type": "application/json"}`                         |
| **Verify SSL**        | Yes (recommended, unless using self-signed cert)               |

You can attach this notification to:

* **Job Templates**
* **Workflow Job Templates**
* **Projects**
  so that every run sends a POST request to the OpenShift listener.

---

## **3️⃣ Experience Required**

To do this successfully, you’ll need to be comfortable with:

* **OpenShift basics**:

  * Creating Deployments, Services, Routes via YAML (`oc apply`).
  * Checking pod/service/route status (`oc get`, `oc describe`).
* **Ansible Controller basics**:

  * Creating notification templates.
  * Attaching them to job templates or workflows.
* **Basic HTTP troubleshooting**:

  * Using `curl` to test the listener.
  * Checking logs from the webhook listener pod (`oc logs`).

---

## **4️⃣ Testing**

After setup:

1. **Test manually**:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://webhook-listener-test.apps.cluster-1234.example.com/ \
   -u testuser:supersecret \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"message":"Hello from curl"}'
   ```

   You should get:

   ```
   Webhook received!
   ```

2. **Trigger from Ansible Controller** by running a job attached to the notification — you’ll see the HTTP POST land in the listener.

---

If you want, I can also give you a **version of this listener that logs the full POST payload** (headers + body) so you can inspect exactly what Ansible sends.
That would be better for real debugging than just returning `"Webhook received!"`.

Do you want me to give you that enhanced YAML next?
